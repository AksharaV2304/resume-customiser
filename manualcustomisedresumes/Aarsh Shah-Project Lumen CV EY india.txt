Relevant Experience
Model Validation Experience:
Validated model accuracy and predictive power through ROC-AUC, Gini coefficient, K-S statistic, and PSI analysis for population stability of wholesale portfolios for a big UK bank.

Other Experience:
Developed a logistic regression-based PD model for a UK bankâ€™s consumer loan portfolio in Python, aligning with IRB standards; performed advanced preprocessing including classing, dummy creation, and feature selection using WoE and IV.

Created a comprehensive scorecard framework, translating model coefficients into risk scores for streamlined decision-making processes.

Developed a centralized Golden Data repository to standardize IRB exercises, integrating multiple data sources quarterly for capital calculation, monitoring, and model testing. Improved analysis by including short-term movements and the latest data each quarter.

Supported the implementation of a segment-specific PD calibration framework for wholesale exposures in line with EBA guidelines, including data cleaning, exclusion criteria, and quality checks to ensure robust segmentation.

Automated counterparty-to-segment mapping using Python and prepared detailed segment-level inputs (obligor counts, default rates) to support LRADR calculations across time periods.
